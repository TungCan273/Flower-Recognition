# Flower-Recognition
This project is a flower recognition system that can identify different types of flowers from an image. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the image and identify the flower species.

# Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:
Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy
OpenCV
Scikit-Learn
TensorFlow

You can install the dependencies using pip. Here's an example command
'pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn tensorflow'

#Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
	https://github.com/TungCan273/Flower-Recognition
2. Navigate to the project directory.
'cd flower-recognition'
3. Run the flower_recognition.py file with an image file path as the argument.
The system will analyze the image and identify the flower species. The result will be displayed on the console.
# Data
Data loaded and trained on the Flowers Recognition dataset, which contains images of different types of flowers. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
